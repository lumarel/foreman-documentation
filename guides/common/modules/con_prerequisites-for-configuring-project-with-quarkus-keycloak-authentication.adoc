= Prerequisites for configuring {Project} with {Keycloak} authentication

Before configuring {Project} with {Keycloak} external authentication, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

* A working installation of {Keycloak} server that uses HTTPS instead of HTTP.
* Configuring Quarkus-based {Keycloak} authentication requires the `--http-relative-path=/auth` context path to be configured in your {Keycloak} system setup.
If you want to use a different context path, make manual adjustments after the initialisation with `/auth` or fully set up the `_foreman-openidc_oidc_keycloak_Foreman_Realm_.conf` file of the `httpd` service manually.

* A {Keycloak} account with admin privileges.
* A realm for {Project} user accounts created in {Keycloak}.
* If the certificates or the CA are self-signed, ensure that they are added to the end-user certificate trust store.
* Users imported or added to {Keycloak}.
+
If you have an existing user database configured such as LDAP or Kerberos, you can import users from it by configuring user federation.

If you do not have an existing user database configured, you can manually create users in {Keycloak}.
