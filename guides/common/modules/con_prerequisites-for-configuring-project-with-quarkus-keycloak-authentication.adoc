= Prerequisites for configuring {Project} with {Keycloak} authentication

Before configuring {Project} with {Keycloak} external authentication, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

* A working installation of {Keycloak} server that uses HTTPS instead of HTTP.
* A {Keycloak} account with admin privileges.
* A realm for {Project} user accounts created in {Keycloak}.
* If the certificates or the CA are self-signed, ensure that they are added to the end-user certificate trust store.
* Users imported or added to {Keycloak}.
+
If you have an existing user database configured such as LDAP or Kerberos, you can import users from it by configuring user federation.

If you do not have an existing user database configured, you can manually create users in {Keycloak}.

* This documentation relies on a {Keycloak} system setup with `--http-relative-path=/auth` configured, if you want to use a different context path, you will need to make manual adjustments or need to manually setup the httpd configuration
